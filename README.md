simple_layout
=============

`simple_layout` is a more flexible alternative to [embedded-layout](https://github.com/bugadani/embedded-layout/).

Improvements
------------
 * simpler API
 * Controls minimum and maximum size of every element
 * Allows controlling the weight of every element on expanding linear layouts
 * can draw borders around the layouted elements

Disadventages
-------------
* No additional geometry elements (but you can still use the elements from [embedded-layout](https://github.com/bugadani/embedded-layout/))
* Not tested for no-std build
